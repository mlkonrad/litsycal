# changes without logging out of the real session. See CLAUDE.md's "Fast
# iteration" section for why this is needed and what it does/doesn't cover.
#
# Each JS module change still requires killing and re-running this script —
# the JS engine can't unload a loaded module, so a fresh gnome-shell process
# is the only way to pick up new code (same reason a plain disable/enable is
# unreliable on this Shell version, see the module-caching caveat below).
